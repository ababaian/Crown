This directory contains two rRNA alignments, one for LSU rRNAs and one for SSU rRNAs. We assembled complete sequences rRNAs from 135 distinct species. The species are intended to represent, as far as available data allow, the broadest sparse sampling of the phylogenetic tree of life, including all three domains of life. The sequences are derived from thirty-two eukaryotic species, sixty-seven bacterial species, and thirty-six archaeal species. The aligned sequences are essentially complete and with low sequence error frequencies, as indicated by cross-validation. Sequences were compiled, aligned, and validated in an extensive iterative process. Initial automated alignments generated by SILVA-ARB were inspected and manually adjusted. Incomplete sequences were manually patched with missing fragments located with BLASTN. 

The alignment is provided in FASTA format.
