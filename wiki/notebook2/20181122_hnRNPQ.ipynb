    "This paper recently came out: [Deletion 6q Drives T-cell Leukemia Progression by Ribosome Modulation](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/11/21/2159-8290.CD-17-0831.full-text.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main finding appears to be that the 6q14- recurrent in T-ALL, leads to loss of SYNCRIP (hnRNP-Q) and SNHG5 (hosting SNORD50A and SNORD50B). The associated ribosome dysregulation results in a shift to monosomes and perturbed ribosome functionality which together, act oncogenically in the context of a synthetic T-ALL model (Tal1-TG, Lmo1-TG + Notch1).\n",
